            <header><h2>Artistic Aspirations</h2></header>
            <p>It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern
            art. Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:
            </p>
            <p>Impressionism<br>
                <span class="tab">Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction
            of light. It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.
                </span><br>
            Abstract Expressionism<br>
                <span class="tab">This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had
            a significant impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.
                </span><br>
            Pop Art<br>
                <span class="tab">A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular
            culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.
                </span>
